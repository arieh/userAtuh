=============
Installation:
=============

1. insert the temp-keys table into your database.
2. edit the config.ini file, to match your users table.
3. you need to supply the handler a mysql_link. in the example i do this with the dbconnect.php file, which can be used as well.
    (you can use the interface to create DB-access objects for other databases)
4. if your passwords are not encoded with sha1 in the database, change the third parameter in the authenticate call to false.

use the examples i gave you to play around with it. notice that if you change the field names in the form, you need to change them in the JS file as well

if you use a different folder structure, supply the keyHandler the location of the ini file (as done in the example).

notice also, that i do not do input validation of any sort (other than check that the user name exists). you should make sure that you do, 
and that you secure the input for SQL injection and XSS (the library now allows you to set a function to run on input before sending it to the DB)
